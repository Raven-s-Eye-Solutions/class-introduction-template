          Prior to deep diving into software development, I worked in nearly
          every aspect of the speciality coffee industry. Hailing from Atl,
          Durham became home three years ago. I am looking forward to being a
          part of BTB, brushing up on skills and learning even more from all of
          you.

          When I am not sitting in front of my computer, I am a busy mama to two
          young humans, baking all kinds of bread and attempting to keep house
          plants alive. “Sometimes I’ll start a sentence and I don’t even know
          where it’s going. I just hope I find it along the way.”
