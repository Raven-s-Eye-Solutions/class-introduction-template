        Prior to deep diving into software development, I worked in nearly every
        aspect of the speciality coffee industry. Hailing from Atl, Durham
        became home three years ago. I am looking forward to being a part of
        BTB, brushing up on skills and learning even more from all of you.

        When I am not sitting in front of my computer, I am a busy mama to two
        young humans, baking all kinds of bread and attempting to keep plants
        alive. “Sometimes I’ll start a sentence and I don’t even know where it’s
        going. I just hope I find it along the way.”
