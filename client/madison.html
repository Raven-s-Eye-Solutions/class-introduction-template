      Hi, I'm Madison! About a year and a half ago I decided I was ready to
      learn to code after graduating with a business degree and working in
      customer service. I attended a coding bootcamp in Durham that ended in
      December 2019. We learned to build full stack applications focusing on
      Javascript and since then I've been working with C# and .NET as contractor
      for a maritime company. My hobbies include cooking new recipes, exploring
      local trails, and watching way too much 90 Day Fiance.
