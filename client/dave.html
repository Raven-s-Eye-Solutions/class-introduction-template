                Before I made the leap into the wonderful world of software I had a long career in sales. This past
                January I graduated
                from a bootcamp in Durham, North Carolina. I have always been interested in technology and I'm so glad I
                made the switch.

                I'm excited to be a part of this group. I'm really looking forward to meeting everyone, brushing up on
                the
                things
                I've learned in bootcamp, and continuing down that software development road. It'll also be cool to
                add some new projects to my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.daveawad.com">portfolio</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="font">
                Outside of my love for coding and learning, I'm also an avid coffee drinker and a big time foodie.
                Although, with the pandemic this hasn't been very easy.
