                Hey everyone! I graduated from a bootcamp in Durham, North Carolina back in January.
                Before I made the leap into the wonderful world of software I had a long career in sales. Fast-forward
                to today, I'm so glad I made
                the switch!
            </p>
            <p class="font">
                Happy I found this group and I'm really looking forward to meeting everyone, brushing up on the things
                I've learned in bootcamp, and continuing down that software development road. It'll also be cool to
                add some new projects to my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.daveawad.com">portfolio</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="font">
                I'm an avid coffee drinker and big time foodie. Although, this pandemic has not made that easy.
            </p>
